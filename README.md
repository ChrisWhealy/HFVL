# HFVL
Hash Function Visualization Language

Created by Andrew Chabot
Advisor: Dr. Hans-Peter Bischof

A simple to use language called the Hash Function Visualization Language or HFVL.
This repository contains all necessary files for created and running files in the language.
There are also visualizations created in the language for SHA-1, SHA-2 256 and SHA-3 256 available in this repository.
These are called *SHA1*, *SHA2*, and *SHA3* respectively. All of these files link to additional subvisualization files,
which are also included in this repository.

## Usage
To run HFVL on a file, simply run the main HFVL.py file. On input you will get a message to input a file.
> Enter HFVL filename to run: 

If you enter an HFVL file, you should get a message that looks like
> file found, loading visualization for: *SHA1*


## Language Syntax
The SHA visualizations serve as examples on how to use HFVl. The syntax of HFVL is somewhat unique, but simplistic in nature.

### Frames

All the visual changes occur within Frames.

Every frame is started with a Frame : command and ended with a Frame End command. A sample frame statement is below.

> Frame 1:
> 
> Frame End
